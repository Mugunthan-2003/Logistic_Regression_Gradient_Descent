# Logistic_Regression_Gradient_Descent
The Program made has two features x1 and x2 and target variable y .
The data is available in log.csv
The focus is to optimize weights w1 and w2 such that w1*x1+w2*x2 approx. to y .
This is done using different Gradient Descent Algorithms like stocastic GD , Batch GD and Mini Batch GD .
